there are 6 types of inheritance
1. single inheritance
2. multi level inheritance
3. Hierarchical inheritance
4. multiple inheritance
5. hybrid inheritance
6. cyclic inheritance

note: super() cannot be used to access parent class instance variable
      access it by using self
	
     if parent class and child class contain instance variable with the same name , then only child class instance variable will be there
     parent class instance variable will be discarded

     with the help of super() we can access parent class static variables
