there are 3 access modifiers in python 
1.public
2.private
3.protected

1. public elememnts are available anywhere inside python code
2. private members are accessible inside python class
3. protected members are only accessible inside the python class and the subclass

note: all the members inside the python class is bydefault public

to declare a member as a private we have to prefix the name by two underscores symbol
example :-->   __x , is defined as variable of name x , and it is private

to declare a member as a protected , we have to prefix the name by one underscores symbol
example :--> _x , is defined as variable of name x , and it is a protected member


note::--> these features are just a convention , it is not implemented strictly at the language level
          i.e. you can access private member outside the class also , just name mangling is there
           _CLASSNAME__VARIABLENAME

          protected member you can happily access anywhere , it is just a convention , 
          but coding wise , no one will access the members outside their scope
