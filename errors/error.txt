nesting of try-except-finally block is possible
if inner except block is unable to handle exception , 
then outer block will get the control to handle inner exception
then at last it will go to pvm

various combinations:
	1. try --> invalid
	2. except --> invalid
	3. else --> invalid
	4. finally --> invalid
	5. try + except --> valid
	6. try + else --> invalid
	7. try + finally --> valid
	8. try + else + except --> invalid
	9. try + else + finally --> invalid
	10. try + except + else + finally --> valid
	11. try + except + try + finally --> valid
	12. try + except + except --> valid

summary:
	1. with try , either except block or finally , atleast one is compulsory
	2. with except , try block should be there
	3. finally without try block is invalid
	4. with else , except block must be there
	5. we can write multiple except block for same try block , but we cannot write multiple else block for the same try block
	6. try - except - else - finally order is important
	7. can do nesting
